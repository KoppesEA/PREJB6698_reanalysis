# PREJB6698_reanalysis
## Summary:
This project is a (re)-analysis of a reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) dataset from DNMT1-TET-OFF mESCs generated by my PhD thesis mentor J.R. Chaillet (U.Pitt) and  initially analyzed by S. McGraw and J. Trasler (McGill University).

## Data Mining Aquisition:
The McGraw et al. RRBS data is found on the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) Record PRJEB6698.
1. Download read file TSV report directly from ENA
2. Use Awk one-liner to extract R1 and R2 FTP locations for 10 samples
```
cat filereport_read_run_PRJEB6698.tsv | awk -F"\t" '{print $7}' | awk -F";" -v OFS="\n" 'NR>1 {print $1, $2}' > PRJEB6698_ACC_List.txt
```
3. Download read experiment XML
4. Use '.bash' or the below command to extract sample metadata
```
cat ena_PRJEB6698_read_experiment.xml | \
grep -o -E ">SAMEA\d{7}<|>ERR\d{6}<|refname\=\"[dN].*>" | \
tr -d '>|<' | tr '\n' ' ' | \
awk -v OFS="\t" ' {print $3, $2, $1, "\n", $6, $5, $4, "\n", $9, $8, $7, "\n", $12, $11, $10, "\n", $15, $14, $13, "\n", $18, $17, $16, "\n", $21, $20, $19, "\n", $24, $23, $22, "\n", $27, $26, $25, "\n", $30, $29, $28}' | \
sed 's/^\t//' | sed 's/refname=\"//' | sed 's/\"//' > PRJEB6698_metadata.tsv
```
